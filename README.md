# CoinDev.io Analysis Token - Whitepaper

## Project

[CoinDev.io Analysis Token](https://coindev.io) is first to market with its innovative Technical Analysis-based token.

Investors and traders of market securities (ie: stocks, futures, and bonds) generally use a trading discipline to evaluate, time, and identify trading opportunities by analyzing statistical trends gathered from historical trading activity.  Price movement and volume trends, amongst others, are metrics that are used to predict future price movement of assets.  Up until now, these techniques have not been applied to the crypto markets.

CoinDev.io Analysis Token is an ambitious and calculated moonshot that democratizes these advanced strategies, generally deployed and protected by large hedge funds, market makers, and investment banks, by making them accessible to all crypto traders worldwide.

## Problem

Crypto markets are notoriously volatile in nature and traders commonly enter token positions in illiquid pairs.  These pairs may appear to be trending upward with sufficient liquidity in the evening and can completely reverse in the morning.

## Solution

CoinDev.io seeks to provide a measure of protection by automatically entering or exiting swap positions while you sleep.
Users are able to develop their own advanced buy and sell signal strategies based on technical analysis chart-based overlays in a user friendly gui interface.  
Programming skills are not required.

A simple example of a strategy:

If the fast moving average crosses above the slow moving average, enter into a token pair position.
If the fast moving average crossed below the slow moving average, exit a token pair position.
